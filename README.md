<h2>Introduction</h2>
Games and Stuff is a web-based database application that allows users to create accounts, login, search for games, add games to their wishlist, and much more. The website link is https://gasgames.tk/. When a user first goes to the website they will see this login page. On it, a user may sign in to their account or if they do not have one, they can sign up for an account. For the purposes of this guide, we have created a demo account with the username of “Gamer@gas” and password “Games123” for you to login with. 

<h2>Navigation Bar - Opening Screen</h2>

![alt_text][navbar]

Once a user first visits the site, this is the home page they will see. If a user has an account, they may simply sign in. If they do not have an account, they must create one or if they do not want to, they can still search the game gallery to see our list of games.

<h2>Create an Account</h2>

If a user does not have an account and they wish to create one, if they click on the “SIGN UP HERE” button on the home screen, they will see the above page. While here, they may go back to the home login page or go to the game gallery. A user may also input details to create an account and click “Signin”. This will create a new account for them which they will be able to come back and login with.

<h2>Navigation Bar - Account</h2>

<h2>Navigation Bar - Game Gallery</h2>
